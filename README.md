## A Framework for Simulation of Magnetic Soft Robots using the Material Point Method (Under Review)
Paper is currently under review but can be made avaliable on request.

Magnetic
soft robots are formed of silicone polymers embedded with
magnetic elements.
Due to the use of external magnetic fields
The relationship between magnetic
soft materials and external sources of magnetic fields present
significant complexities in modelling due to the relationship
between material elasticity and magnetic wrench (forces and
torques) 

We aim to contribute an easy to use simulator for magnetic soft robots capable of modelling dynamic behaviour using the Material Point Method. 

magneticMPM is built with the [Taichi](https://www.taichi-lang.org/) programming language.
